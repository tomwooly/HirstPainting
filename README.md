# HirstPainting
A replication of a Damien Hirst coloured dots painting using the turtle module within Python.


This has been completed by importing the turtle & colorgram modules into my Python project.  I have then imported the RBG colour values from an image of a famous Damien Hirst coloured dots artwork, also uploaded 
into my project folder so this can be used by the main.py file.

Once this is completed, the drawing has been plotted by coding my turtle, named 'tom' to replicate the drawing, using multiple turtle module variables, just as penup(),speed(),forward(), setheading(), hideturtle() etc.
